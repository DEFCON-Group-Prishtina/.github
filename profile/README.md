# DEF CON Group Prishtina (DCG 38338)

DEF CON Group Prishtina is the official local DCG chapter for Prishtina, Kosovo.

Our focus is **hacker culture**.

We promote curiosity, experimentation, creative use of technology, learning by disassembling, and sharing knowledge openly and responsibly.

We aim to connect the local hacker scene in Kosovo with the wider global DEF CON community. That means ideas, people, projects, and culture flowing both ways — from Prishtina to DEF CON villages, groups, and conferences around the world, and back again.

Our activities include meetups, talks, workshops, live demos, zines, hardware and software hacking sessions, wargames, and informal knowledge sharing. Topics can range from reverse engineering, exploitation, and hardware hacking to AI systems, art, games, history of hacking, and anything else hackers find interesting.

This GitHub is a shared space for community output: experiments, demos, notes, tools, write-ups, and artifacts created by DCG Prishtina members and friends.

All skill levels are welcome. Curiosity and kindness above all.

Hack the planet.
